# Test Report

## Strategy
1. I tested with a manual demo app (`codeMetric.js` as CLI) to check all core features.
2. I ran the analyzer on 5 different repositories to verify language detection.

## Environment
* Node.js v18
* Git v2.40
* OS: Windows 11

## Test Cases (Manual)

| What was tested | How | Result |
|----------------|-----|--------|
| Analyze default repo | Ran `node codeMetric.js` with no args → checked console output | Cloned repo, showed `md 46.82%`, `js 28.57%`, `json 24.61%` |
| Keep files option | Used `{keepFiles: true}` → checked if `./cloned-repository` exists after | Directory remained with all files intact |
| Clone repository | Called `cloneRepository(url)` → checked filesystem | Created `./cloned-repository/repo-name` with Git files |
| Invalid repo URL | Tried `'https://github.com/fake/notreal.git'` → observed error handling | Showed error message, no crash |
| Load custom languages | Created `languages.txt` with `py,java,go` → ran analyzer | Only counted those 3 languages, ignored others |
| Missing languages.txt | Deleted file → ran `loadSupportedLanguages()` | Created file with 27 default languages automatically |
| Calculate sizes | Ran on test folder with known file sizes → verified calculations | Returned correct MB values per extension |
| Empty repository | Analyzed repo with no code files → checked output | Showed "No supported files found" |

## Manual Checks (demo app)

* `analyzeLanguageDistribution('./local-project')` works on local directories without Git.
* `getDefaultLanguages()` returns array with 27 languages (js, ts, py, java, etc).
* `removeDirectory(path)` handles both existing and non-existing directories without errors.
* Platform detection works: uses correct commands on Windows (`rmdir /s /q`) vs Unix (`rm -rf`).
* Error messages are clear: "Check: Git installed? Repository accessible? Internet connection?".

## Summary

All 8 public functions work correctly. The analyzer successfully identifies 27+ programming languages and calculates accurate file size distributions. Edge cases like invalid
repos and missing files are handled gracefully.

One known limitation: large repositories (>1GB) take significant time without user feedback. All core functionality is verified and ready for use.
